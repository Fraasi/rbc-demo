## react-big-calendar demo example

I needed a calendar, so I built this little thing to learn how react-big-calendar works. Includes also a simple modal to add/edit/delete events.  
Maybe this is a useful example for some others learning how all the bits and pieces work together and how to modify the calendar.

All react :grin:
* react-big-calendar
* react-modal
* react-datepicker
